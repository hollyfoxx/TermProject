# TermProject

11/17
So, I think the source code/project files from the original app is pretty dated, which was making it super hard to work with in Android Studio. As a workaround I created a new Android Studio project, and just copied over the source code and necessary libraries. I've only made a few updates -- adding buttons and pages (called 'activities' in Android Studio) for the countdown and Christmas support(?)/fun page. 

The new project files can be found in the Christmas2.zip. I also exported and uploaded my Android Studio settings... idk if they're necessary to get it to work for you guys but I figured it wouldn't hurt, and consistency is always a good thing. 

IMPORTANT THINGS!!!! : 

* Make sure Android Studio/Gradle/Whatever is completely up to date otherwise you'll have issues. 
* Compile SDK version is API 26 Android 8.0 (Oreo)
* Min SDK is 15
* I've been emulating through Android Studio. The virtual device I've been using is a Nexus 5C API 27
* To open the project, In Android Studio > File > Open > your_repository/Christmas2
* To import settings > File > Import settings... > .../settings.jar
* To save your work > CLOSE project in file > close, and then push the repo
